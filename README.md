Intellicane is an AI-powered fresh take on your typical walking cane. Powered by YOLO's latest machine learning models and paired with a computer vision system, the cane is able to detet objects in the user's surroundings and read them aloud for the visually impaired. What's more, the cane's proximity sensor will automatically trigger an audible warning to the user if they are about to run into something or there is a suddden change in elevation (ex. chairs, depression in the round, etc.)
